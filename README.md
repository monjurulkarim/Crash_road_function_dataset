# Visual dataset for driving scene classification
No public datasets are available for training a deep learning neural network to classify crash scenarios with a pre-crash class and the US road functional system. This repository addressed this issue by developing two datasets that contain a diverse set of driving scenes with various road types. 
This repository contains 4 different datasets.
* Crash likelihood classification
* Road function classification (i.e. interstate, local, etc.)
* Weather classification
* Time of the day classification
