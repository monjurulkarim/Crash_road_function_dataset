# Crash and road function dataset
No public datasets are available for training a deep learning neural network to classify crash sce-12narios with a pre-crash class and the US road functional system. This repository addressed this issue by developing two datasets that contain a diverse set of driving scenes with various road types. 

The below figure contains some example from crash dataset.
